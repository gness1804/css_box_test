This is a simple test to create temporary borders around container elements to make developing and testing CSS easier. When the user presses "b" (this button can obviously be adjusted), a dotted red border appears around elements designated with the "testing" class. When the user presses "b" again, the border disappears.

The test can be easily disabled with deploying a site live (I might try to streamline this).
